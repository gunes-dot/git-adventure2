    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>
    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    <p>Git is love, git is life. Git is the air we breathe.</p>
    <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
    <p>It's new to me. I believe it is created to separate the core of the work to many alternative solutions/processes without losing the core work</p>
    <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
    <p>"The working tree, or working directory, consists of files that you are currently working on. You can think of a working tree as a file system where you can view and modify files. The index, or staging area, is where commits are prepared. The index compares the files in the working tree to the files in the repo." -Google</p>
    <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
    <p>"The staging area is like a rough draft space, it's where you can git add the version of a file or multiple files that you want to save in your next commit (in other words in the next version of your project)" -Google</p>
    <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
    <p>git pull command</p>
